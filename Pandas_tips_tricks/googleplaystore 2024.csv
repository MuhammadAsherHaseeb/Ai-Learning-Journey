Thank you for your feedback.
If the app asks you for a password it means that you have set up a password. When you set up a password you can also set a recovery email address for situations when you don't remember your password.  If you didn't provide an email address we cannot reset your password.

The app doesn't keep them. So you've got to remember every detail in one go. I've looked at several other password managers and none had such a good interface as this. Simple, logical.  But the above shortcoming needs to be addressed.",3,2,2016-09-30 11:40:48,"Hi Fyuuredhijgfzre,

Thank you for your kind words. Related to this issue, we believe that the Android system is resetting the app. This happens when you have a lot of apps running in the background. The system tries to allocate memory for the active apps and closes the background apps.
If the issue persist please contact support.

Not sure if its just me or this app does not have any help section for novice users. Will try figuring it around for a bit else will uninstall.",2,2,2016-09-17 14:15:15,"Hello,

You need to add your accounts manually(websites/apps). When you add an account you can set different filters for it. You also have the possibility to add your own filters by going to the settings section. If you still encounter difficulties please contact support@managerpass.com and we will be very happy to help you.
